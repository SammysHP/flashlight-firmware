Description: "Bistro-HD", bistro your way. OTSM, eswitch, Vcc reads, safe_presses, turbo timeout...
  Flintrock's massively-upgraded version of Bistro, with support for all sorts
  of new things.  Primarily OTSM (off time sleep mode), which makes button
  press timings consistent regardless of temperature, with no need for an
  analog OTC (off time capacitor).
