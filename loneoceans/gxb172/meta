Description: GXB172 driver example firmware
    Single-Cell ~50W 17mm Boost LED Flashlight Driver
    Note - The ATtiny841 is configured to run with internal 8MHz oscillator, low CKDIV8 unchecked
        As a result, set fuses to 0xFF, DF, C2 (ext, Hi, Low)
        This firmware is a very preliminary firmware and there will probably be several bugs! Use at your own risk :)
