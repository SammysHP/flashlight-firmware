This is my Convoy/XinTD X3 firmware. It's nothing that special or difficult,
but since TK helped me with it I figured I'd share it here.

blf-A6 was the starting point, but as it sits all the hidden modes and mode
reversing are commented out.

It still has the two mode groups.

The first group is for li-on use:

  - 4 modes, moon on the 2nd channel, then L>M>H on the main channel
  - LVP turned on

The second group is for use with the 3*AA carrier:

  - 3 modes, L>M>H all on the 2nd channel (to avoid over-drawing alkalines,
    ~760ma in my X3)
  - LVP turned off
