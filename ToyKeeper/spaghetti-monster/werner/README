This is a Werner-style interface for dual-switch lights
(e-switch + clicky switch).  What that means is:

While the clicky switch is off:

  - Click the clicky switch:  Turn on, at the last-used level.  The clicky
    switch works as a momentary mode.

  - Click the clicky switch while holding the e-switch:  Go into sort of a
    utility mode.

While on, in a normal steady mode:

  - Click the clicky switch: Turn off.

  - Click the e-switch: Brighter.  One step per click.

  - Hold the e-switch: Dimmer.  Keep holding to go down multiple steps.

While in standby, in utility mode:

  - Click the e-switch: Turn on.

  - Hold the e-switch: Turn on at lowest level.

  - Double-click the e-switch: Turn on at highest level.

  - Triple-click the e-switch: Battery check mode.

  - Quad-click the e-switch: Ramp config mode.

While in battery check mode:

  - Click either switch: Turn off.

  - Double-click the e-switch: Go to temperature check mode.

While in temperature check mode:

  - Click either switch: Turn off.

  - Double-click the e-switch: Go to battery check mode.

  - Quad-click the e-switch: Go to thermal config mode.

Ramp config mode and thermal config mode work the same as in Anduril or
RampingIOS V3.  The options are:

  - Ramp config mode:
    1. Floor level.
    2. Ceiling level.
    3. Number of steps.

  - Thermal config mode:
    1. Calibrate sensor by entering current temperature in C.
    2. Set temperature limit to 30 C + N clicks.
