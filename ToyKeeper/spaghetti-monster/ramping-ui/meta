Description: Example ramping UI for FSM.
    Also shows how to do a couple other things:
      - battcheck / tempcheck
      - simple thermal regulation
      - adjustable-speed strobe
    This was sort of an early prototype for Anduril, but has been abandoned
    and is only here to demonstrate some ideas.
