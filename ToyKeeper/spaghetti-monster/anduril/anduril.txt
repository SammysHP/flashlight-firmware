From off:

  Ramp shortcuts:
  * 1 click: memorized level
  * Hold: lowest level then ramp up
  * 2 clicks: highest ramp level
  * Click, hold: highest level then ramp down

  Blinkies:
  * 3 clicks: specials (battcheck, goodnight, beacon, tempcheck)
  * Click, click, hold: strobes
    (candle mode, bike flasher, party strobe, tactical strobe,
     lightning storm mode)
    (remembers which you last used)

  Other:
  * 4 clicks: lock-out
  * 5 clicks: momentary mode (disconnect power to exit)
  * 6 clicks: muggle mode

In steady mode:
  * 1 click: off
  * Hold: ramp up
  * Click, hold: ramp down
  * 2 clicks: to/from turbo (actual turbo, not just highest ramp level)
  * 3 clicks: toggle smooth vs discrete ramping
  * 4 clicks: configure current ramp

Smooth ramp config mode:
  - Setting 1: memory on/off  (not implemented yet)
  * Setting 2: low end
    (click N times to set ramp floor to level N)
  * Setting 3: high end
    (click N times to set ramp ceiling to level "151 - N")

Discrete ramp config mode:
  - Setting 1: memory on/off  (not implemented yet)
  * Setting 2: low end
    (click N times to set ramp floor to level N)
  * Setting 3: high end
    (click N times to set ramp ceiling to level "151 - N")
  * Setting 4: number of levels in discrete ramp
    (click N times to make discrete mode have N stair-steps)
    (minimum 2, maximum 150)

"Strobe" group modes:

  Candle mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: next "strobe" group mode
    * 3 clicks: add 30 minutes to the timer
                (light will shut off when timer expires)
                (default is no timer)
    * Hold: brighter
    * Click, hold: dimmer

  Bike flasher:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: next "strobe" group mode
    * Hold: brighter
    * Click, hold: dimmer

  Party / Tactical strobe modes:
    * 1 click: off
    * Hold: change speed (faster)
    * Click, hold: change speed (slower)
    * 2 clicks: next "strobe" group mode
      (TODO: random/police strobe?)

  Lightning storm mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: next "strobe" group mode

"Blinky" group modes:

  Battcheck mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: goodnight mode

  Goodnight mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: beacon mode

  Beacon mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: tempcheck mode
    * 3 clicks: configure time between pulses

    Beacon config mode:
      * At buzz, click N times to set beacon frequency to N seconds.

  Tempcheck mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: battcheck mode
    * 3 clicks: thermal config mode
    - Hold: thermal calibration mode

    Thermal config mode:
      * Setting 1: calibrate sensor:
        At buzz, click N times for N degrees C.  For example, if the light 
        is current at "room temperature" of 22 C, click 22 times.  Is 
        intended to only be done once upon initial setup, or not at all.
      * Setting 2: temperature limit:
        At buzz, click N times to set thermal limit to roughly 30 C + N.

    Thermal calibration mode:
      - Hold until hot: set new ceiling value
      - ... don't hold: blink out current ceiling value and exit

Lockout mode:
  * Hold: momentary moon
  * 4 clicks: exit lockout (return to regular "off" mode)

Momentary mode:
  * Press button: Light on (at memorized level).
  * Release button: Light off.
  * To exit, disconnect power.  (loosen/tighten the tailcap)

Muggle mode:
  * 1 click: On / off.
  * Hold: Ramp up / down.
  * 6 clicks: Exit muggle mode.

TODO:
  * save settings in eeprom
  * decide on "hold until hot" or "click N times" for thermal config mode
  * test thermal regulation on an actual light
  * improve thermal regulation
  - a way to blink out the firmware version?
  * indicator LED support
  * a way to configure indicator LED behavior?
  * add goodnight mode?
  * add lightning mode?
  * muggle mode: smooth ramp
  * refactor to make config modes smaller
  * move all config menus to four clicks
  * candle mode timer, with three clicks to add 30 minutes
  - diagram updates for 3-click special actions
  - candle mode: smoother adjustments?
  - make sunset mode timer and brightness configurable?
