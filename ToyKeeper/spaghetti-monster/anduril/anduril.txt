    * 2 clicks: next "strobe" group mode

"Blinky" group modes:

  Battcheck mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: goodnight mode

  Goodnight mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: beacon mode

  Beacon mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: tempcheck mode
    * 4 clicks: configure time between pulses

    Beacon config mode:
      * At buzz, click N times to set beacon frequency to N seconds.

  Tempcheck mode:
    * 1 click: off
    * 2 clicks: battcheck mode
    * 4 clicks: thermal config mode
    - Hold: thermal calibration mode

    Thermal config mode:
      * Setting 1: calibrate sensor:
        At buzz, click N times for N degrees C.  For example, if the light 
        is current at "room temperature" of 22 C, click 22 times.  Is 
        intended to only be done once upon initial setup, or not at all.
      * Setting 2: temperature limit:
        At buzz, click N times to set thermal limit to roughly 30 C + N.

    Thermal calibration mode:
      - Hold until hot: set new ceiling value
      - ... don't hold: blink out current ceiling value and exit

Lockout mode:
  * Hold: momentary moon
  * 4 clicks: exit lockout (return to regular "off" mode)
  * On hardware with an indicator LED...
    * 3 clicks: Change aux LED brightness used in lockout mode.
                (the modes are usually off/low/high/blinking)

Momentary mode:
  * Press button: Light on (at memorized level).
  * Release button: Light off.
  * To exit, disconnect power.  (loosen/tighten the tailcap)

Muggle mode:
  * 1 click: On / off.
  * Hold: Ramp up / down.
  * 6 clicks: Exit muggle mode.

Indicator LED support:

  The indicator LED, if there is one, tracks the brightness of the main 
  LED(s) during use.  It'll be off, low, or high depending on whether 
  the main emitter is off, using only the first power channel, or using 
  a higher level.

  The indicator LED can stay on when the light is in the "off" state or 
  lockout state.  The user can configure each state to be low, high, or 
  off.  To configure it:

    1. Go to lockout mode.  (4 clicks)
    2. Click 3 times, optionally holding the third press, to change the 
       value:
       * 3 fast clicks: Change lockout mode button brightness.
       * Hold the third click: Change regular "off" mode button 
         brightness.  Let go when desired level is reached.
    3. Exit lockout mode.  (4 clicks)


TODO:
  * save settings in eeprom
  * decide on "hold until hot" or "click N times" for thermal config mode
  * test thermal regulation on an actual light
  * improve thermal regulation
  - a way to blink out the firmware version?
  * indicator LED support
  * a way to configure indicator LED behavior
    * Go to lockout mode, then click three times.  Hold the third click 
      to change regular "off" brightness, or make it a fast click to 
      change lockout mode brightness.
  * add goodnight mode?
  * add lightning mode?
  * muggle mode: smooth ramp
  * refactor to make config modes smaller
  * move all config menus to four clicks
  * candle mode timer, with three clicks to add 30 minutes
  * diagram updates for 3-click special actions
  - candle mode: smoother adjustments?
  - make sunset mode timer and brightness configurable?
  - make beacon mode actually sleep between pulses
