Description: "Bistro" firmware for clicky-switch lights
  General-purpose clicky-switch light firmware with many runtime config options
  to customize the interface to individual preferences:
  - 1 to 8 regular modes plus optional moon
  - low-to-high or high-to-low mode order
  - mode memory, or not
  - medium-press to go backward, or not
  - thermal calibration mode sets the maximum allowed temperature
  - "muggle mode" simplified UI for use while lending the light to others
  Default config fits on an attiny25, which can be used on drivers designed for the attiny13.
  So, there is no need to build a special driver board with extra room for tiny45/85.
  Should work on both FET+1 and single-channel drivers, though the single-channel ones
  will need to be recompiled with a different brightness level table.
