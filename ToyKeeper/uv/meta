Description: S7-like code intended for use on a UV blacklight
 Has four solid modes, heartbeat beacon, four strobe modes, and battcheck.
 Strobes have longer duty cycles than party strobes, but not as long as
 tactical strobes.  This should help it make UV-sensitive objects blink
 without using as much power as a tactical strobe.
