Open Issues
-----------
- ADDED on 2017/10/15: 2017/10/15: (from MAD777, maybe others) if strobes are disabled, a 2X click from 2X turbo
    should restore the previous level you were at
- FIXED on 2017/10/15: 2017/10/12 BUG: 4X clicks in modes operation engages lockout - not supposed to
- ADDED on 2017/10/15: 2017/10/08: operation change: make click&hold in MODES or STROBES wrap from 1st mode to last

- FIXED on 2017/10/15: 2017/10/04 BUG: in LVP switch LED control: the LED sometimes is left
  on after an LVP drop, and is not blinking the way it should be. The "bug" is that I'm trying
  to control the switch LEDs from multiple places so it's getting turned off quickly after turned
  on, and left on when it should be left off. It's a timing thing, so has sort of a random
  pattern - sometimes left on, sometimes left off.
  The 8 sec LVP blink need to be qualified better, and should not be calling Setlevel() as is
  because it wants to control the LED

- FIXED on 2017/10/15: 2017/10/01 temp stepdown should not happen right away from turn ON.
  Delay it, least by 15 seconds! (yes - delayed 15 secs from turnong ON)

- FIXED on 2017/10/15: 2017/09/29 BUG: for temperature stepdown, in moon mode, a temp stepdown
  is actually done because moon mode is marked as special level 255, which is considerred as a
  high level of output instead of very low. The stepdown results in the light switching much
  brighter. This should only happen id the temperature threshold is set to a low temp, or the
  light is still hot and not cooled down when moon mode is chosen. It can also result in an
  immediate jump to the stepdown level as soon as the light is turned on in moon mode. Might
  appear as a bright flash when ramping first starts.

- re-work triple channel ramping tables: add more to the FET range, check/test for different
  # of 7135's in the bank (5/27: not sure this is necessary now with new 3 chan ramping table)

- (from JasonWWW) triple channel mode sets are not completely defined, and are different than 2
  chans - need to, at a minimum, document it this way
- (from JasonWWW) possible problem with mode memory in 3 chan config - must check it out
  
Possible New Features
---------------------
- besides supporting turbo/max on power up, add support if powered up with the button pressed,
  come up in moon (lowest) mode
- joechina recommended to do a quick ramp to max, maybe even quick fade to OFF to ease tension to
  the eyes. The Olight A1R does this.
- enhancing tailswitch support: full mode sets w/memory (Lexel)
- add ability to have timed and temp step down simultaneously (Lexel)
- research "bump protection" - tolerate a short loss of power
- build in a method to show the current config settings
- more blinky modes, like lightning, campfire, etc.

Done Issues/Features
- FIXED: Tom E: in mode sets, step down settings wasn't working correctly
- FIXED: 1 Lexel/BLF spotted: Blinkies unable to turn off in ramping
- FIXED: delay processing of fast click operations to avoid max/turbo flash and allow more fast
  click options (over 4 doesn't work)
- DONE: add in buck driver support cleanly (BLF GT)
- DONE: add momentary/tactical mode
