Vers 1.2 2017-10-16
- changed momentary/tactical mode so fast clicks have no effect, and only way to exit is to power cycle

Vers 1.2 2017-10-15
- if strobes are disabled, a 2X click from 2X turbo should restore the previous level you were at
- BUG FIXED: 4X clicks in modes operation engages lockout - not supposed to
- operation change: make click&hold in MODES or STROBES wrap from 1st mode to last
- BUG FIXED: in LVP switch LED control: the LED sometimes is left on after an LVP drop, and is not
  blinking the way it should be. The "bug" is that I'm trying to control the switch LEDs from
  multiple places so it's getting turned off quickly after turned on, and left on when it should
  be left off. It's a timing thing, so has sort of a random pattern - sometimes left on, sometimes
  left off. The 8 sec LVP blink need to be qualified better, and should not be calling Setlevel()
  as is because it wants to control the LED
- BUG FIXED: temp stepdown should not happen right away from turn ON. Delay it by 15 seconds
- BUG FIXED: for temperature stepdown, in moon mode, a temp stepdown is actually done because moon
  mode is marked as special level 255, which is considered as a high level of output instead of very
  low. The stepdown results in the light switching much brighter. This should only happen id the
  temperature threshold is set to a low temp, or the light is still hot and not cooled down when moon
  mode is chosen. It can also result in an immediate jump to the stepdown level as soon as the light
  is turned on in moon mode. Might appear as a bright flash when ramping first starts.

Vers 1.1 2017-08-12
- added in the BLF GT Buck driver support, all conditionally compilied in
- to build what you want, choose the applicable setup header file, and tk-calib header file.
- added capability to ramp to less tham max FET/Buck, then dbl click goes to full max
- added a new momentary/tactical mode feature 5X click to enter/exit it, it blinks 5X (2 slow, 3 quick)
  on entry and exit. Also if the blinkies are disabled, the 2X click in ramping turbo will instead
  enter momentary mode, then 2X or 5X exits.
- fixed a bug for 3 channel, #6 mode set where 5% was set wrong: was 255, 10%, corrected to 150

Vers 1.0 2017-05-29
- restored default moon level PWM value back to 3 for the 2 channel Q8. The ramping table
  starts at level 3, so to work with the current ramping nicely, 3 should be defaulted
Vers 1.0 2017-05-28
- bumped up the default moon level from a PWM value of 3 to 4, just in case the low value gives
  us problems with the 7135's in production (4 is a little better, might not be enough)
- changed default temp stepdown from 54 to 55
Vers 1.0 2017-05-20
- in ramping, when you 3X click for battery level, or 4X click for lock-out, no more max
  level flashing. So a 2X click to max is now slightly delayed
- in Mode Sets, you can now access temp readings and version # readings (2X click navigate,
  just like in ramping)
- reset to factory defaults is now accessible from Mode Sets (non ramping) because you can
  get into the version # blinking out state
- in Mode Sets, slightly lengthened time it takes to get into strobe (1.1s to 1.2s): trying
  to make it slightly harder to inadvertently access it
- in Mode Sets, lengthened the time to get into the Config Settings UI (from 2.5s to 3.2s):
  also attempt to make inadvertent access slightly less likely
- Lock-Out can be exited by either 2X click and quick click&hold, or 4X clicks. This way
  the light can be in Lock-Out and use the "Mode Sets" way to exit, or the "Ramping" way to exit

Vers 1.0 2017-05-14 --> Initial Release
- combined Narsil (2 chans) with NarsilTriple, and breaking out compile time settings
  to a separate header file called: setups.h
- Bug Fix: in ramping, blinky modes were unconditionally being invoked even if disabled by
  the user -- fixed this
- Bug Fix: in Mode Sets confoguration, the timed/thermal step down settings were not handled
  right, mis-interpreted -- fixed this
- New Feature: you can now reset the settings to factory defaults by press&hold while in
  version # display mode
- changed the intense (1st) strobe to 18 Hz from 16 Hz (made it more intense) and added
  the setting as an option in setups.h
- timeouts for a configuration setting of no clicks was 3.2 seconds, now 3.5 seconds:
  slightly longer.
- timeouts for a configuration setting with clicks was 1 second, now 2 seconds: longer
 (this timeout was pretty quick)
