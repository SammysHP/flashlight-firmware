Vers 1.0 2017-05-29
- restored default moon level PWM value back to 3 for the 2 channel Q8. The ramping table
  starts at level 3, so to work with the current ramping nicely, 3 should be defaulted
Vers 1.0 2017-05-28
- bumped up the default moon level from a PWM value of 3 to 4, just in case the low value gives
  us problems with the 7135's in production (4 is a little better, might not be enough)
- changed default temp stepdown from 54 to 55

Vers 1.0 2017-05-20
- in ramping, when you 3X click for battery level, or 4X click for lock-out, no more max
  level flashing. So a 2X click to max is now slightly delayed
- in Mode Sets, you can now access temp readings and version # readings (2X click navigate,
  just like in ramping)
- reset to factory defaults is now accessible from Mode Sets (non ramping) because you can
  get into the version # blinking out state
- in Mode Sets, slightly lengthened time it takes to get into strobe (1.1s to 1.2s): trying
  to make it slightly harder to inadvertently access it
- in Mode Sets, lengthened the time to get into the Config Settings UI (from 2.5s to 3.2s):
  also attempt to make inadvertent access slightly less likely
- Lock-Out can be exited by either 2X click and quick click&hold, or 4X clicks. This way
  the light can be in Lock-Out and use the "Mode Sets" way to exit, or the "Ramping" way to exit

Vers 1.0 2017-05-14 --> Initial Release
- combined Narsil (2 chans) with NarsilTriple, and breaking out compile time settings
  to a separate header file called: setups.h
- Bug Fix: in ramping, blinky modes were unconditionally being invoked even if disabled by
  the user -- fixed this
- Bug Fix: in Mode Sets confoguration, the timed/thermal step down settings were not handled
  right, mis-interpreted -- fixed this
- New Feature: you can now reset the settings to factory defaults by press&hold while in
  version # display mode
- changed the intense (1st) strobe to 18 Hz from 16 Hz (made it more intense) and added
  the setting as an option in setups.h
- timeouts for a configuration setting of no clicks was 3.2 seconds, now 3.5 seconds:
  slightly longer.
- timeouts for a configuration setting with clicks was 1 second, now 2 seconds: longer
 (this timeout was pretty quick)
