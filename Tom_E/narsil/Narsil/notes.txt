=========

2017-04-03:
- no known repeatable bugs at this time

Open Issues:
 1: possibly easier/quicker way to toggle between ramping and mode sets, or redesign to
    combine ramping and mode sets
 2: possibly remove memory mode for mode sets (not very intuitive)
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------
       UPDATES
------------------------------------------------------------------
Vers 1.3 2017-04-02:
- added thermal stepdown capability, and blinking out the approx. temperature reading
- restructured config UI to make it ramping/mode set specific - much simpler for ramping
- added option for reading of voltage via 1.1V internal reference source (no R1/R2, use R1/R2 optionally)
- in ramping, if going to moon from OFF, moon won't overwrite the last saved level

Vers 1.3 2017-02-15:
- reduced timeout from OFF to standby/sleep from 10 secs to 5 secs
- implement blinking of the ind. LED when ramping completes to indicate what channel the output is on
- blinks the ind. LED of output channel for click to last level

Vers 1.2 2016-11-30:
- added the USING_3807135_BANK switch for supporting 380 7135's

Vers 1.2 2016-09-04:
- added support for 2.2V, 2.3V and 2.4V reporting (min was 2.5V)
- in ramping, remove the 3X click toggle of the locator LED (4X click for lock-out turns it off anyway)
- bug fix: mode sets 9-12 could not be selected!! Fixed this.

Vers 1.1 2016-09-01:
- re-wrote LVP handling to fix a couple bugs and handle ramping-moon mode properly
- blink 8 times when shutting off the level by dropping below the critical level, 2.6v now (was 2.7v)
- changed timing of LVP check to every 4 secs, not 3 secs, added a 1/4 sec delay after the drop
- in ramping, Add Dbl-click in Batt Check: blink out vers # of firmware
- in ramping, Add Dbl-click on max to enter strobe modes

Vers 1.12 2016-07-16:
- in ramping, add 4X click to do a lock-out
- add attempt to disable brown-out detection when going in to power saving (not working on my Attiny85's)
- bug fix: sometimes, ramping up from OFF, then release, then ramp again quick - it ramps up but should
  ramp down -- fixed this
- don't let a dbl-click to MAX effect the saved output level (ramping to a level is the last save level)
- added a new mode set in slot #8 for 10-25-50 levels (no max), original #11 is dropped
- bug fix: flaky, bad problems could have happened for the mode sets #8 to #12 -- fixed this

Vers 1.11 2016-07-11:
- bug fix: dbl-click or triple-click in Battery Check mode were being acted on (should be ignored)
- in ramping, add a timeout, after which, to not toggle/change the ramping direction
- bug fix: with turbo-timeout enabled and in ramping with moon mode active,
  the turbo-timeout kicks in and turns up the output to turbo drop down level -- fixed this
- slightly speed up multiple click timing (shorten LOCK_OUT_TICKS from 16 to 14)
- in ramping, if you turn the light from OFF to ON to the previous level, the direction will now
  default to lo->hi
- add changes in an attempt to eliminate power fluctuations causing a lockup or coming on with the
  LED ON (lockup still happens, but doesn't seem to come up with the LED on and light still
  operational anymore)

Vers 1.10 2016-07-06:
- add validation marker byte (0x5d) to avoid loading erroneous config settings - seems to work in
  fixing the observed behavior (still open issue on lockup)
- add flicker when ramping reaches the limits
- bug fixes: if holding the button for entering battery check, don't allow config setting or strobe
  modes to be started
- bug fix: in ramping, when click to last level and last level is moon, the ind. LED was left ON -- fixed this
- add a compile switch to enable reverse ramping direction (toggling)
